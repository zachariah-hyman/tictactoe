tictactoe gui with pygame

I built this simple GUI in order to learn about Pygame and Python.

This was my first try at Pygame and I loosely followed the beginning of this tutorial to learn how to get set up and draw a couple rectangles:

To run this game you just need python3 installed. Save the source code as "tictactoe.py on your computer. Go to the command line and, in the directory where you saved the source code, type `python3 tictactoe.py`

Note: if you're running the game on a Mac, you need to have XQuartz 2.7.11 installed, otherwise it will take a long time to start the game up (about 10 seconds)
